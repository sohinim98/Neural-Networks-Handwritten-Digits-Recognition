# Neural-Networks-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
In this repository, I have implemented both regularized multi-class logistic regression and multi-class neural networks (the one-vs-all approach) to recognize handwritten digits.
For a large number of pixels (inputs), neural networks is certainly the better choice since logistic regression is essentially a linear function and using polynomial regression with a large number of pixels (features) can get computationally expensive.
My neural network has 3 layers- an input layer, a
hidden layer and an output layer. In this case, our inputs are pixel values of
digit images. Since the images are of size 20Ã—20 (grayscale image), this gives us 400 input layer
units (excluding the extra bias unit which always outputs +1). The neural network has 25 units in the second layer (hidden layer) and 10 output units (corresponding to the 10 digit classes).
